    <div>
      <h2 className="newSection">Getting Started</h2>
      <h3>
        Step 1: Invite your teammates to the <code>#lunch_buddies</code> channel
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The app works by polling the members of a Slack channel to see who is
          interested in participating. When you installed the app, a default{" "}
          <code>#lunch_buddies</code> channel was created. You should invite
          your teammates to this channel.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Step 2: Create the poll</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          To initiate the process, type the following message in the
          #lunch_buddies channel.
        </p>
        <img src="/img/create_1.png" style={imgStyle} />
        <p>
          You can customize both the times of the poll and the size of the
          groups. Here are a few examples:
        </p>
        <img src="/img/create_2.png" style={imgStyle} />
        <img src="/img/create_3.png" style={imgStyle} />
        <p>
          It is possible to have multiple polls going at the same time; they are
          uniquely defined by the channel from which they were created. For
          example, you could "create" a poll in the #seattle_office channel and
          also in the #san_francisco_office channel. Members of each channel
          will be independently polled and grouped.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Step 3: Respond to the poll</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          After receiving the <code>create</code> command, the bot will
          individually poll the members of the channel asking about
          participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/img/poll.png" style={imgStyle} />
        </p>
        <p>Participants can select their time preference or opt out.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Step 4: Close the poll</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Navigate back to the "#lunch_buddies" channel and type the following
          message:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/img/close.png" style={imgStyle} />
        </p>
        <p>
          The bot will randomly group people and start a group chat between all
          of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/img/group.png" style={imgStyle} />
        </p>
      </div>
      <style jsx>{`
        .newSection {
          margin-top: 5rem;

        }
      `}</style>
